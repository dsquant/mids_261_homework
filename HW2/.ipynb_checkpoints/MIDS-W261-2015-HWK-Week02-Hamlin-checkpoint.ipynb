This approach, while easier to write and debug, is unlikely to be the best choice for a larger scale implementation because of the large volume of data that would have to be sent to the reducers.  A potentially more-streamlined alternative would be to add a \"combiner\" step at the end of the mapper that would send one line for each word-email combination (E.G. Key:email-word-flag, Value:count).\n",

In this situation, our mapper could simply emit words along with their conditional class counts. I have not implemented this in this homework, but we'll want to keep this in mind for the future. "

    "The scikit-learn version of Multinomial NB does significantly better than our MapReduce implementation.  This is because, by default, scikit-learn implements Laplace smoothing (alpha=1.0).  Adding smoothing makes a major difference when we have words that do not appear in a class.  Instead of simply using the class prior, Laplace smoothing allows us to incorporate these words into our model (albeit with a low class conditional probability).  \n",

    "To confirm, I reran the code for HW 1.5 using the (now commented out) code to implement this smoothing (these results are not shown above for brevity).  When I do this, I'm able to reproduce the 0.0 training error generated by the scikit-learn implementation.  In either case, it's not surprising that we should see no training error, because we are evaluating our model on the same dataset on which we trained it."

    "When running the different flavors of Naive Bayes in scikit-learn, we see that the Bernoulli implementation has a slightly higher error rate than the Multinomial version, which correctly classifies all the emails.  The difference here derives from the assumptions required for each model.  In the Bernoulli NB implementation, features are assumed to come from a bernoulli distribution, that is, each feature is assumed to be binary.  In contrast, a multinomial NB model assumes features come from a discrete distribution (each feature is a categorical variable, rather than binary).  Since our source data is in terms of word counts (in both the MapReduce and Scikit-Learn implementations), we should expect the Multinomial NB to perform better than the Bernoulli version."
