    "*What is a merge sort? Where is it used in Hadoop?* \n",
    "\n",
    "Merge sort is an algorithm that takes two sorted lists and merges them into a single sorted list.  It does this by tracking two pointers at the top of each list. In each iteration, the values of the two pointers are compared, and the smaller of the two is appended to the final list.  Therefore, as the algorithm iterates, the end result is a single sorted list. Hadoop uses merge sort during the shuffle process to take the multiple spill files that are generated for each partion and merge them together before sending them to the combiner.  Merge sort is also used on the reducer side to combine files received from multiple mappers into a single stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How is a combiner function in the context of Hadoop? Give an example where it can be used and justify why it should be used in the context of this problem.*\n",
    "\n",
    "A combiner function is used to combine records with the same key before they are transferred to the reducer.  For example, in a word count implementation, if a mapper generates two key-value pairs for the same word, a combiner would combine those two records together into a single pair with the same key and a value representing the sum of the two input values.  In Hadoop combiners can be used to reduce the amount of information that must be sent via the network from the mappers to the reducers.  In the previous word count example, if combiners were omitted, the mappers would have to send two pairs across the network.  But, by adding a combiner, only one pair per word needs to be sent.  This reduction in traffic can make a dramatic difference in the processing speed associated with a particular job, especially at large scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What is the Hadoop shuffle?* \n",
    "\n",
    "The shuffle is the process by which Hadoop sorts the output of the mappers and transfers it to the reducers.  It consists of three main steps: the partition, the sort, and the combine. The partition step takes the output of the mapper and partitions the results, by key, into separate files (one file for each reducer). In the sort step, records within the same partition are sorted.  Finally, the combine step takes records with the same key and merges them together.  Once these steps are completed, the output can then be transferred to the reducer.\n"

    "##HW3.1. Using Counters to do EDA\n",
    "\n",
    "*Counters are lightweight objects in Hadoop that allow you to keep track of system progress in both the map and reduce stages of processing. By default, Hadoop defines a number of standard counters in \"groups\"; these show up in the jobtracker webapp, giving you information such as \"Map input records\", \"Map output records\", etc.* \n",
    "\n",
    "*While processing information/data using MapReduce job, it is a challenge to monitor the progress of parallel threads running across nodes of distributed clusters. Moreover, it is also complicated to distinguish between the data that has been processed and the data which is yet to be processed. The MapReduce Framework offers a provision of user-defined Counters, which can be effectively utilized to monitor the progress of data across nodes of distributed clusters.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*The [consumer complaints](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vbalm3yva2rr86m/Consumer_Complaints.csv?dl=0) dataset consists of diverse consumer complaints, which have been reported across the United States regarding various types of loans. \n",

    "\n",
    "*Now, letâ€™s use Hadoop Counters to identify the number of complaints pertaining to debt collection, mortgage and other categories (all other categories get lumped into this one) in the consumer complaints dataset. Basically produce the distribution of the Product column in this dataset using counters (limited to 3 counters here).*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hadoop offers Job Tracker, an UI tool to determine the status and statistics of all jobs. Using the job tracker UI, developers can view the Counters that have been created.

    "This code works very similarly to the word count jobs we ran in the previous homework, with the addition of the counters.  Since we need to produce both raw frequencies and relative frequencies for each word, we need to use order inversion to make sure that the total word count is available to the reducer before it begins iterating through the individual words.  We can accomplish this by taking advantage of the Hadoop shuffle and assigning the total a special key that will be automatically sorted to the top before the data is passed to the reducer.  Thankfully, we only have one reducer, so no fancy partioning is necessary to make this work."

    "The first mapreduce job does the majority of the work.  The mapper emits one space-delimited row with the format {product_id cart_id 1 number_of_products_in_cart] where cart_id is a auto incremented identifier for the row to make the largest cart easy to find at the end.  By passing the number of products in the cart along with each product, we can track the largest cart in the reducer as we iterate through all the mapper output.  In addition, we use an order-inversion pattern to emit the total number of all products seen as the first record(s) that the reducer sees.  This enables lazy calculation of product relative frequencies without the need for storing many intermediate values in memory."

    "Again, we are running this job on a single Macbook Pro with 2 cores using two mappers and two reducers.  This time though, we find the job takes 3 minutes and 2 seconds to run, with the mapper and reducer both getting called twice.  This extra runtime is likely caused by the fact that reducing is a more computationally complex process when we're using stripes.  Pairs, on the other hand, generates many more intermediate data points for the reducer to process, though their structure is simpler.  The main benefit of the stripes paradigm is that it reduces the amount of network throughput required during a job, and it's in this exchange of data points that efficiencies can be created.  However, since we're running this job on a single machine rather than a cluster, the network traffic savings don't outweight the additional computational complexity of the stripes reducer step."
